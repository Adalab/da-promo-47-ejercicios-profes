MxPx started as three 15-year-old kids calling themselves Magnified Plaid pounding out music inspired by and similar to The Descendents and other Southern California punk rock bands. They didn’t really love their band name, however, which was a tribute to the original guitarist’s penchant for wearing one particularly loud plaid shirt.

Smog,"Bill Callahan, born in Silver Spring, Maryland. Callahan followed the lo-fi genre of underground rock, with homemade tape-albums recorded on four track tape recorders. Later he signed a record contract with the label Drag City.

Callahan started out as a highly experimental artist, utilizing sub-standard instruments and recording equipment. His reason for using the lo-fi approach was not so much an aesthetic choice, rather it came from his lack of knowledge of recording studios, and fear of giving up control to professional engineers. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Smog"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",472870,9808267,"Bill Callahan, Palace Music, Silver Jews, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, Palace Brothers, Songs: Ohia, Magnolia Electric Co., Purple Mountains, Vic Chesnutt, Will Oldham, Jason Molina, Lambchop, Sparklehorse, Sun Kil Moon, Cass McCombs, Papa M, Mount Eerie, Loose Fur, Little Wings, M.

Peter White,"Peter was born in England, as one of four kids, and soon learned to play a variety of instruments such as recorder, clarinet, cornet, trombone, violin, harmonica, and piano.

This time consuming production process is one of the reasons Koop's albums are released 4-5 years apart.

Roy Eldridge,"Roy David Eldridge (January 30, 1911 – February 26, 1989) was a jazz trumpet player in the Swing era. His sophisticated use of harmony, including the use of tritone substitutions, resulted in him sometimes being seen as the link between Louis Armstrong-era swing music and Dizzy Gillespie-era bebop. Roy's rhythmic power to swing a band was a dynamic trademark of the Swing Era.

Eldridge was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Jiří Antonín Benda,"Jiří Antonín Benda (1722-1795) was Czech composer of early classicism. Younger brother of František Benda.

Rousseau's idea of a scenic melodrama stimulated Benda to create this new genre. In his dramatic and instrumental works, he preceded Beethoven in many things and, in the atmosphere of his work, even Romanticism. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD+Anton%C3%ADn+Benda"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",3249,13251,"Antonín Vranický, Jan Ladislav Dusík, Jan Václav Antonín Stamic, Antonín Rejcha, František Benda, František Ignác Antonín Tůma, Karel Ančerl, Vítězslava Kaprálová, Pavel Vranický, Miloslav Kabeláč, František Xaver Dušek, Josef Mysliveček, Bohuslav Martinů, Petr Eben, Brno State Philharmonic Orchestra, Vítězslav Novák, Johann Stamitz, Pavel Josef Vejvanovský, Alois Hába, Giovanni Battista Viotti, Franz Anton Hoffmeister, Josef Suk, Jan Zach, Johann Baptist Vanhal, Jan Křtitel Vaňhal, Adam Michna z Otradovic, Jan Dismas Zelenka, Joseph Martin Kraus, Jan Ladislav Dussek, Christoph Ernst Friedrich Weyse, Antonio Rosetti, Carl Stamitz, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, Christian Cannabich, Václav Neumann, Prague Philharmonic Chorus, Franz Krommer, Czech Integrated Ensemble, Jakub Jan Ryba, Franz Ignaz Beck, Georg Christoph Wagenseil, Franz Benda, Franz Danzi, Charles Avison, František Xaver Brixi, Prague Symphony Orchestra, Alessandro Rolla, Johann Wilhelm Wilms, Bohuslav Matěj Černohorský, Friedrich Kuhlau, Paul Wranitzky, Giovanni Battista Sammartini, Franz Xaver Richter, Leopold Mozart, Johann Christian Bach, Anton Stamitz, Leopold Hofmann, Friedrich Burgmüller, Jan Josef Ignác Brentner, Jan Krtitel Vanhal, Louis Glass, Ferdinand Ries, Franz Berwald, Karel Husa, Pietro Locatelli, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Giovanni Paisiello, Zdeněk Fibich, Michael Haydn, Joseph Fiala, Muzio Clementi, Adalbert Gyrowetz, Johann Simon Mayr, Jaroslav Tůma, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, Alessandro Marcello, Baldassare Galuppi, Ignaz Pleyel, Antonio Soler, Alessandro Stradella, Leopold Koželuch, Hans Krasa, Orchestra Da Camera Di Roma, Jiří Ignác Linek, Carlos Seixas, Benedetto Marcello, Milan Slavický, Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Niels Wilhelm Gade, Hugo Alfvén, Рейнгольд Морицевич Глиэр, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Pavel Haas, Antoine Reicha, Николай Андреевич Римский-Корсаков, Andante, Louis Spohr, Antonio Salieri, Carl Reinecke"

Rameau’s music is characterised by the exceptional technical knowledge of a composer who wanted above all to be renowned as a theorist of the art.

Henryk Górecki,"Henryk Mikołaj Górecki (6 December 1933 – 12 November 2010) was a Polish composer of contemporary classical music. According to critic Alex Ross, no recent classical composer has had as much commercial success as Górecki.

His Webernian-influenced serialist works of the 1950s and 1960s were characterized by adherence to dissonant modernism and drew influence from Luigi Nono, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Kazimierz Serocki. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Henryk+G%C3%B3recki"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",196103,1382475,"Arvo Pärt, John Tavener, Alfred Schnittke, Krzysztof Penderecki, Karol Szymanowski, Arnold Schönberg, Gavin Bryars, Benjamin Britten, Валентин Васильович Сильвестров, Dmitri Shostakovich, John Adams, Igor Stravinsky, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Olivier Messiaen, Francis Poulenc, Béla Bartók, Leoš Janáček, John Cage, Franz Schubert, Philip Glass, Sergei Prokofiev, György Ligeti, Kronos Quartet, Morton Feldman, Gustav Mahler, Anton Webern, Antonín Dvořák, Charles Ives, Georg Friedrich Händel, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Samuel Barber, Paul Hindemith, Anton Bruckner, Robert Schumann, David Lang, Gabriel Fauré, Alban Berg, Kaija Saariaho, Aaron Copland, Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky, Zbigniew Preisner, Maurice Ravel, Giacomo Puccini, Ludwig van Beethoven, Henry Purcell, William Walton, Giacinto Scelsi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Michael Nyman, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Max Richter, Jean Sibelius, Witold Lutosławski, Julius Eastman, Iannis Xenakis, Caroline Shaw, Manuel de Falla, Carl Orff, Sir Edward Elgar, Georg Philipp Telemann, Erik Satie, 武満徹, Дмитрий Дмитриевич Шостакович, Արամ Խաչատրյան, Ottorino Respighi, Richard Strauss, Felix Mendelssohn, Nico Muhly, Per Nørgård, Frédéric Chopin, Domenico Scarlatti, Luciano Berio, Alan Hovhaness, Meredith Monk, Franz Joseph Haydn, Thomas Adès, Simeon ten Holt, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Carl Nielsen, Camille Saint-Saëns, Bryce Dessner, Harold Budd, Wojciech Kilar, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Federico Mompou, Balanescu Quartet, Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Wagner, György Kurtág, Gustav Holst, Heitor Villa-Lobos, George Antheil, Bruce Brubaker, Leonard Bernstein, Alexander Scriabin, Jeroen Van Veen, Hans Abrahamsen, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Eleni Karaindrou"

Byrd's life is interesting because of his Roman Catholic sympathies combined with his work in the court of the Anglican Queen Elizabeth I.  <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/William+Byrd"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",88326,785486,"The Tallis Scholars, Thomas Tallis, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, John Dowland, Anonymous, Guillaume de Machaut, Claudio Monteverdi, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Hildegard von Bingen, [anonymous], Tomás Luis de Victoria, Georg Friedrich Händel, Georg Philipp Telemann, Gabriel Fauré, Gregorio Allegri, John Tavener, Franz Schubert, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Felix Mendelssohn, Igor Stravinsky, Henry Purcell, Karol Szymanowski, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Charles Ives, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Richard Strauss, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Orlande de Lassus, Anton Bruckner, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Fretwork, Robert Schumann, Jean Sibelius, Orlando Gibbons, John Bull, Josquin des Prez, Franz Joseph Haydn, Benjamin Britten, Maurice Ravel, Leoš Janáček, Richard Wagner, Paul Hindemith, Thomas Tomkins, Béla Bartók, Michael Praetorius, The Sixteen, César Franck, Дмитрий Дмитриевич Шостакович, John Taverner, Carlo Gesualdo, Ottorino Respighi, Marin Marais, Guillaume Dufay, Johannes Ockeghem, Cipriano de Rore, Sir Edward Elgar, Jacob Obrecht, Alexander Scriabin, Peter Philips, Thomas Weelkes, Francis Poulenc, Gustav Mahler, Christopher Tye, Antonín Dvořák, Stile Antico, Alonso Lobo, Jean Mouton, Heinrich Isaac, Josquin Desprez, Gustav Holst, John Sheppard, Bedřich Smetana, George Gershwin, Tobias Hume, Aaron Copland, Giovanni Gabrieli, Emilio de' Cavalieri, Jacobus Clemens non Papa, Samuel Barber, Johann Pachelbel, Antonio de Cabezón, Pierre de Manchicourt, Nicolas Gombert, Giles Farnaby, Adrian Willaert, Robert Parsons, Orlando di Lasso, Diego Ortiz, Pierre de La Rue, Robert White, Claudin de Sermisy, Frederick Delius, Heinrich Schütz, Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni, Cristóbal de Morales, Alonso Mudarra, Johann Hermann Schein, John Wilbye, Francisco Guerrero, Camille Saint-Saëns"
